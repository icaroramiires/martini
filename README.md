:airplane: It was published in [IEEE Latincom 2019](https://latincom2019.ieee-latincom.org/) and the paper :notebook: is available at [MARTINI: Towards a mobile and variable time window identification for spatio-temporal data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8937868)

:clock2: The goal is to identify distinct time windows that characterize a single context each, and propose a mobile and variable time window. It is a strategy to characterize spatio-temporal data that adds context to solutions.
